## Resources

* [How the Minetest client uses the API](https://github.com/minetest/contentdb/blob/master/docs/minetest_client.md)


## Responses and Error Handling

If there is an error, the response will be JSON similar to the following with a non-200 status code:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "The error message"
}
```

Successful GET requests will return the resource's information directly as a JSON response.

Other successful results will return a dictionary with `success` equaling true, and
often other keys with information. For example:

```js
{
    "success": true,
    "release": {
        /* same as returned by a GET */
    }
}
```


### Paginated Results

Some API endpoints returns results in pages. The page number is specified using the `page` query argument, and
the number of items is specified using `num`

The response will be a dictionary with the following keys:

* `page`: page number, integer from 1 to max
* `per_page`: number of items per page, same as `n`
* `page_count`: number of pages
* `total`: total number of results
* `urls`: dictionary containing
    * `next`: url to next page
    * `previous`: url to previous page
* `items`: array of items


## Authentication

Not all endpoints require authentication, but it is done using Bearer tokens:

```bash
curl https://content.minetest.net/api/whoami/ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOURTOKEN"
```

Tokens can be attained by visiting [Settings > API Tokens](/user/tokens/).

* GET `/api/whoami/`:  JSON dictionary with the following keys:
    * `is_authenticated`:  True on successful API authentication
    * `username`:  Username of the user authenticated as, null otherwise.
    * 4xx status codes will be thrown on unsupported authentication type, invalid access token, or other errors.
* DELETE `/api/delete-token/`: Deletes the currently used token.

```bash
# Logout 
curl -X DELETE https://content.minetest.net/api/delete-token/ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOURTOKEN"
```
